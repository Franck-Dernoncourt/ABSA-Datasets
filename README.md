# ABSA-Datasets-Info
Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a natural language processing problem that requires analyzing user-generated reviews to determine: a) The target entity being reviewed, b) The high-level aspect to which it belongs, and c) The sentiment expressed toward the targets and the aspects. 
Numerous yet scattered corpora for ABSA make it difficult for researchers to identify corpora best suited for a specific ABSA subtask quickly. This repository provides a list of all the publicly available datasets for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis along with the matching subtasks for each of the datasets. 

We provide the following information in the form of tables:
- [What are the exisiting subtasks of ABSA? What are the inputs and expected outputs of each Subtask and when it was introduced?](Subtasks-Info.md)
- [What are the publicly available datasets for ABSA without the aspect category annotations?](Datasets-without-Aspect-Categories.md)
- [What are the publicly available datasets for ABSA with the aspect category annotations?](Datasets-with-Aspect-Categories.md)
- [Which datasets could be used for which subtasks and which subtasks could be tackled using which datasets?](Datasets-Subtasks.md)
